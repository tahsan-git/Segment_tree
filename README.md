# 🧩 Segment Tree Implementations

Welcome to the **Segment Tree** repository!  
This repo contains clean and well-documented implementations of various types of segment trees with real problem applications from platforms like [Codeforces EDU](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/4/1).  
Each folder or file may include a specific variation of the segment tree and its explanation.

## 📚 What is a Segment Tree?

A **Segment Tree** is a binary tree used for efficient range queries and updates. It is widely used in competitive programming to solve problems involving:

- Range sum / minimum / maximum
- Range updates (like addition or assignment)
- Lazy propagation for optimization
- Frequency counts, GCD, XOR, and more

## 🛠 Implementations

| File/Folder             | Description                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `basic_sum.cpp`         | Simple segment tree for range sum    |
| `range_min.cpp`         | Range Minimum Query (RMQ)            |
| `lazy_update.cpp`       | Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation   |
| `count_min.cpp`         | Stores both min value and its count  |
| `point_update.cpp`      | Point updates with range queries     |
| `range_set_add.cpp`     | Range add/set operations (Codeforces)|
| `README.md`             | You are here                         |

> 📁 Each file is self-contained with inline comments and a `main()` function for testing.
